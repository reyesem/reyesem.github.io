<p>When the same response is collected multiple times on a single subject, the assumption of independence is almost certainly violated. In order to obtain valid inference, the correlation introduced in the data should be appropriately modeled. Understanding these models can lead to more powerfully designed studies.</p>
<div id="importance-of-study-design" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Importance of Study Design</h2>
<p>Study design is too often separated from the statistical analysis that follows. However, in addition to informing the conclusions we draw regarding the data, the study design helps in choosing an appropriate analysis to address the question of interest. As an example, consider the following study reported in <span class="citation">Vittinghoff et al. (<a href="#ref-Vittinghoff2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:rm-enzyme" class="example"><strong>Example 12.1  (Digestive Enzymes)  </strong></span>The ability of the bowels to properly absorb nutrients can be impacted by a lack of digestive enzymes. This presents as excess fat in the feces. Pancreatic enzyme supplements can be given to ameliorate the problem. A study was conducted comparing three forms of a particular enzyme supplement; these were compared to no supplement (placebo) as a control. Subjects were given the supplement to take for a specified length of time; then, the amount of fecal fat (g/day) present was recorded. The data is presented in Table <a href="rm-terminology.html#tab:rm-enzyme-data-table">12.1</a>.</p>
Interest is in determining if the amount of fecal fat produced, on average, differed for any of the treatments.

<p>Using the methods developed in the previous unit, we could readily develop a model for this process:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(\text{Fat})_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{Tablet})_i + \beta_2 (\text{Coated})_i + \beta_3 (\text{Uncoated})_i + \varepsilon_i.\]</span></p>
<p>where <code>Tablet</code>, <code>Coated</code>, and <code>Uncoated</code> are indicator variables capturing the impact of the categorical treatment group. Our hypothesis of interest is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0 \qquad \text{vs.} \qquad H_1: \text{At least one } \beta_j \text{ differs}.\]</span></p>
<p>This analysis demonstrates no evidence (p = 0.1682) the average amount of fecal fat differs for any of the supplement forms (see Figure <a href="rm-terminology.html#fig:rm-terminology-enzyme-plot">12.1</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:rm-terminology-enzyme-plot"></span>
<img src="images/rm-terminology-enzyme-plot-1.png" alt="Data from a digestive enzyme study assuming 24 subjects." width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 12.1: Data from a digestive enzyme study assuming 24 subjects.
</p>
</div>
<p>Of course, the above analysis is predicated on the data being consistent with the conditions for the classical regression model. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that the fecal fat present in one subject is independent of the fecal fat present in any other subject once we have accounted for the type of supplement. Therefore, it seems reasonable that any two fecal fat measurements above are independent once we have accounted for the type of supplement received. This, however, follows from how we assumed the data was collected — that each measurement is from a different subject.</p>
<p>Let’s reconsider the above example but add a little more context to the study design.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:rm-enzyme-expanded" class="example"><strong>Example 12.2  (Digestive Enzymes Expanded)  </strong></span>The <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> study was designed as a cross-over study enrolling six subjects. Each subject was placed on a form of the enzyme (determined randomly) and followed for a specified period of time at which point the amount of fecal fat present was obtained. Following a substantial wash-out period the subject was assigned a different form of the supplement. This continued until each subject had been assigned to all four supplement forms. The data, with the subject identifier information is presented in Table <a href="rm-terminology.html#tab:rm-enzyme-data-table-expanded">12.2</a>.</p>
Interest is in determining if the amount of fecal fat produced, on average, differed for any of the treatments. However, it is known that the amount of fecal fat present can vary substantially from one individual to another due to dietary preferences; researchers would like to account for the variation in the fecal fat across subjects when performing the analysis.

<p>The additional information about the study design (the cross-over study results in several measurements being taken on each subject) indicates that the observed measurements are not independent. Instead, there is a relationship between certain responses.</p>

<div class="rmdtip">
For those familiar, you may recognize the <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> example as a “block design.” Others may be familiar with the “paired design,” of which this is a generalization. While the idea is similar, the methods discussed in this text are a more inclusive approach.
</div>

<p>Why would recording multiple observations on the same subject impact the condition of independence? Looking at the data reveals that the values of fecal fat vary greatly from subject to subject, ranging from 9 to 71 g/day in some cases. This could be the result of different diets; however, such dramatic differences are never noted among measurements from the same subject. That is, the variability <em>between</em> subjects is substantially larger than the <em>variability</em> within a subject. This makes it difficult to find the signal between the supplement forms. Ignoring this information in our previous analysis results in reduced power.</p>
<p>To better understand why researchers would design such a study, we review attributes of good study design. Generally speaking, there are three components to any well-designed study: replication, randomization, and comparative groups.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-replication" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.1  (Replication)  </strong></span>Taking measurements on different subjects for which you expect the results to be similar (differences due only to natural variability).
</div>

<p>Replication allows us to estimate subject-to-subject variability. Our intuition is that more data is better; in fact, increasing the sample size (the number of <em>unique</em> subjects on which we collect data) will result in less variability in our estimates. That is, the sampling distribution for these estimates will be narrower. Increased replication also leads to increased power — the ability to detect a signal when it really exists.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-randomization" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.2  (Randomization)  </strong></span>Random sampling refers to the selection of subjects from the population at random while random allocation refers to the assignment of subjects to treatment groups at random.
</div>

<p>There are many forms of random sampling. Some sampling schemes ensure each collection of subjects is equally likely, while others ensure representation. Some sampling schemes are weighted to oversample from some subpopulation. Each scheme shares the goal of eliminating bias, making the data more representative of the target population. While random sampling is the ideal, it is not always feasible. In clinical trials, for example, patients must elect to participate, thereby making the sample not random. When a random sample is not possible, summarizing the data to ensure it is representative of the target population is critical.</p>
<p>There are many forms of random allocation. Some randomization schemes ensure each treatment group is equally likely, while others assign to an active treatment with a higher likelihood than the placebo. Other randomization schemes, like that mentioned in the <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> example randomizes the <em>order</em> of treatments. Each scheme shares the goal of eliminating confounding, allowing for causal interpretations. Whenever possible, random allocation is utilized, but it is not always feasible. Perhaps most famously, it was deemed unethical to conduct a randomized controlled trial to investigate the link between smoking and cancer. Therefore, observational studies were utilized.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-comparative-groups" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.3  (Comparative Groups)  </strong></span>The treatment groups (factors) should be as similar as possible to reduce the inclusion of additional variation in the process.
</div>

<p>Intuitively, the less variation in the response, the easier it is to detect a signal. This leads naturally to saying that we could eliminate extraneous variability if the groups were <em>identical</em>; that results in using the same subjects in multiple groups, resulting in taking repeated measurements on the subjects.</p>
</div>
<div id="studies-with-repeated-measures" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> Studies with Repeated Measures</h2>
<p>Studies which have repeated measurements taken on subjects typically violate the condition of independence. While the above design concepts apply broadly, the following terminology is specific to such studies.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-repeated-measures" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.4  (Repeated Measures)  </strong></span>Data for which the observed responses can be grouped based on some nuisance variable (typically the subject itself) which captures some inherent characteristic about the subject such that observations within a group tend to be more alike than observations across groups.
</div>


<div class="rmdtip">
The “paired data” setting (typically studied alongside the “paired t-test”) is a special case in which there are only two observations per group.
</div>

<p>As discussed in the context of the <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> example above, the large variability between subjects relative to the variability within subjects can swamp out the treatment effect if not accounted for appropriately. From a more theoretical perspective, this difference in the variability induces a correlation structure among the error in the responses.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-correlation-structure" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.5  (Correlation Structure)  </strong></span>Quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between the errors in the observed responses.
</div>


<div class="rmdkeyidea">
Ignoring the correlation structure does not tend to affect the parameter estimates, but it often affects the resulting standard errors, thereby impacting confidence intervals and p-values.
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to predict if the confidence intervals will widen or narrow; similarly, we cannot predict whether the p-values are too high or too small. As a result, ignoring the correlation structure in the data can result in inappropriate inference. In order to obtain appropriate inference, we will need methods which account for this structure.</p>

<div class="rmdkeyidea">
When the data is correlated, it must be taken into account in all aspects of the analysis, from the graphics to inference.
</div>

<p>In order to illustrate the impact of the correlation structure on an analysis, consider representing the data from the <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> example in which we connect observations from the same subject (Figure <a href="rm-terminology.html#fig:rm-terminology-enzyme-plot-extended">12.2</a>). While there are some exceptions, notice how the lines do not “mix” often; that is, some subjects tend to have less fecal fat than others, regardless of the form of the supplement given. Even visually, we see that we should not focus on the overall average for each treatment group; instead, we see that for nearly every subject, the fecal fat is reduced with the supplement (compared to placebo). It may not be immediately obvious if there is a difference among the form of the supplement, but it seems clear that having the supplement is better than not having it.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The repeated measures in the <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> example is the result of blocking in order to obtain comparative groups.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-blocking" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.6  (Blocking)  </strong></span>One way of controlling for an inherent characteristic that contributes additional variation. All observations that are linked through the characteristic are grouped together and random allocation (if applicable) occurs within the block.
</div>

<p>Blocking is useful when we can identify the nuisance characteristic in advance of data collection. Blocking is a way of ensuring the treatment groups are similar because the same subjects (with respect to this particular characteristic) end up in each treatment group. We know that random allocation eliminates confounding because it ensures that, on average, treatment groups are similar. Blocking alone does not eliminate confounding; it must be combined with randomization. However, if we account for the blocking in the analysis, we are able to sharpen our estimates because not only has balance occurred, we are able to explain a portion of the variability within each treatment group.</p>
<p>The introduction of blocks suggests that not all “grouping” variables are treated the same. We think about variables differently depending on their role in the model for the data generating process. Loosely, we can categorize factors as either fixed or random effects.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-fixed-effect" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.7  (Fixed Effect)  </strong></span>Terms in the model for which we are interested in both the specific values observed and characterizing the relationship it has with the response.
</div>

<p>In addition to the treatment/factor of interest, this can include anything we want to account for in the model in such a way that if we were to repeat the study, the same levels would be visible again. In terms of the parameters in the model, we think of the parameters as constants (though unknown) which hold true for all individuals. In the <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> example, the form of the supplement is the fixed effect. If we were to repeat the study, we would still expect to use these same four levels (placebo, tablet, coated and uncoated capsule). And, we might readily believe that the difference between a placebo and a tablet is the same for all subjects.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-random-effect" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.8  (Random Effect)  </strong></span>Terms in the model that capture the correlation induced due to an inherent characteristic that varies across the population and for which we are <em>not</em> interested in the specific values observed or characterizing the relationship it has on the response directly.
</div>

<p>This is generally <em>not</em> the treatment/factor of interest; in fact, we are rarely interested in saying how such terms directly impact the response. We believe that the variability in the response among the groups is large relative to the variability in the response within such groups. The induced correlation can therefore be partitioned out using these variables. In the <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> example, the subject is a random effect. Groups of observations on the same subject are more alike than observations across subject. If we were to repeat the study, it is unlikely we would use these same six subjects. Instead, we see these subjects as representative of a random sample from some population; therefore, the difference between subjects 1 and 2 is not of real interest and would change from one study to the next.</p>

<div class="rmdtip">
In order to distinguish fixed and random effects in a model, think about repeating the study; would you care if the levels of the factor were to change? Are you interested in comparing the first level to the second? If you answer “yes” to these questions, the factor is most likely a fixed effect.
</div>

<p>A key idea in regression modeling is partitioning variability. The more things you can explain, the better your comparison of interest. We are removing elements from the “junk drawer” (the elements contributing to the error between observations). With a random effect, we are partitioning out something that we believe fluctuates and the specific values are of no interest.</p>
<p>In the <em>Digestive Enzymes</em> example, each observation is from a unique combination of the subject on which it was observed and the treatment assigned at that time. This is not the only form of a study that can result in repeated measurements. In the biological sciences, it is common to record the response several times on the same subject.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:defn-subsampling" class="definition"><strong>Definition 12.9  (Subsampling)  </strong></span>A process in which each subject has several measurements of the response taken, possibly at unique locations.
</div>

<p>In a study with subsampling, the unit of observation is the subject itself. For example, the subject is randomized to a particular treatment; however, the response of interest is measured multiple times. As an example, a person may be assigned to a particular treatment to improve eyesight. The subject’s eyesight is then measured in each eye; the person is the unit of measurement but we obtain two measurements of the response (eyesight), one corresponding to each eye. This is sometimes referred to as “pseudo-replication,” and many researchers can mistakenly believe they have a larger sample size than exists in reality; the observations recorded on the same subject are related and should not be treated as independent observations.</p>
<p>Before examining methods for addressing studies with repeated measures, we need to make a clear distinction. When we use the phrase “repeated measures,” we mean repeatedely measuring the same response. All regression models make use of multiple variables measured on the same subject. The models discussed in this unit refer to measuring the same response repeatedly.</p>
