      <h2>About the Award</h2>
      <p>Bill Kline exemplified humility, integrity, compassion, and hard work.  He often stressed the importance of understanding the "big picture" to ensure value-creation.
      Recipients of the Bill Kline Innovation Award embody those qualities and are recognized for their ingenuity, innovation, ability to manage complex systems using a systems 
      perspective and, most importantly, their project's overall impact on society.</p>

      <h2>Applying for the Innovation Award</h2>
      <p>Any project wishing to be considered for the Innovation Award should submit a short video summarizing their project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(1 minute) Introduction to the team and the problem to be solved.</li>
        <li>(2 minutes) Explanation of the project; this should be a high-level "elevator pitch" on the work completed which might, depending on your discipline, focus on how 
        the technology works, what your device does, or the primary results of the research, for example.</li>
        <li>(2 minutes) Description of how you managed the complexity of the project using a <em>systems perspective</em> and the <em>project's overall impact on society</em>; 
        for non-engineering disciplines, a "systems perspective" might look like linking your work to the broader literature, describing considerations for various stakeholders, 
        and placing the components of your work within a larger framework of your discipline.</li>
        <li>(1 minute) Conclusion and future applicability of the project.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The above timing guidelines are recommendations; the video should be approximately 6 minutes in length.</p>
      
      <p>Completed videos will be uploaded to a file on Panopto; instructions for preparing and submitting the video can be found at the following link:</p>
