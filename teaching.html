      <p>Rose-Hulman operates on a quarter system. Each statistics course meets for four 50-minute periods per week 
      over the course of a 10-week term. While the content for each of my courses is hosted on Moodle (our course 
      management system), a brief summary of each course I teach is provided below.  When available, additional 
      information on each course can be obtained by clicking on the title of the course.</p>

      <h2>Senior Projects and Theses</h2>
      
      <p>The senior capstone experience can fall into one of the following categories:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Statistical Collaboration</strong>: This consists of an analysis of data to advance another
        scientific discipline; this is generally provided by a client. This is generally viewed as a 
        <em>Senior Project</em>.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Numerical Investigation of Existing Method</strong>: This consists of characterizing the 
        behavior of an existing method in a previously unexplored setting using numerical simulations.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Development of New Statistical Theory</strong>: After researching an open problem in the 
        field, a novel approach is proposed and characterized using theory and/or numerical simulations.</li>
        
        <li><strong>State of the Art</strong>: An in-depth summary of methodological developments for a 
        topic in the field.  This extensive literature review should represent a novel contribuion to the field.</li>

      <h2>Courses Taught Regularly</h2>
            
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="ma223sample.html">Engineering Statistics I (MA223)</a></strong><br>
        Technically calculus-based, this introductory course is designed to capitalize on the strong mathematical 
        background of Rose-Hulman students while emphasizing statistical concepts over mathematical computations.  
        The statistical process is highlighted: formulating a question of interest in terms of parameters that 
        characterize the population, collecting data appropriately for addressing the question of interest, 
        summarizing the information available within the sample, characterizing the variability in our statistics, 
        and performing inference about the parameters using the available sample.  We introduce students to 
        sampling methods, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, simple linear regression analysis, ANOVA, and
        repeated measures ANOVA.</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href="ma386sample.html">Statistical Programming (MA386)</a></strong><br>
        This course introduces tools and strategies for data management, manipulation and analysis that are common 
        in statistics and data science.  These skills are developed primarily in the R computing language.  This 
        class encourages students to build their portfolio in applied work.</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href="ma482sample.html">Biostatistics (MA482)</a></strong><br>
        This course introduces the analytical tools commonly used in the biological sciences.  Emphasizing modeling,
        this course covers repeated measures, categorical response variables, censored survival (or reliability), and
        nonlinear relationships.  Other topics discussed as time permits include pooling results from multiple studies, 
        handling missing data, study design and power, and drawing causal conclusions from observational data.  The course 
        is not meant to provide an in-depth statistical treatment of these topics, but instead aims to enable students 
        to evaluate the strength of evidence presented in the literature within their field of study.  Largely driven 
        by small projects analyzing real data, the course focuses on identifying when the application of these techniques 
        is warranted and interpreting the results produces by these methods (such as those found in the medical literature).</li>

    <!-- Additional Courses -->
    <article id="additional-courses" class="primary-article">
      <h2>Additional Courses Taught</h2>
      
      <ul>
 	      <li><strong><a href="ma481sample.html">Mathematical Statistics (MA481)</a></strong><br>
        This course introduces students to the analytical tools needed to establish the properties of common statistical 
        methods.  Beginning with a discussion of random vectors, including the generation of random variates for use in a 
        simulation study, we explore the properties of a random sample.  This includes convergence concepts such as the 
        consistency of a statistic and its limiting distribution (including a proof of the central limit theorem).  Maximum 
        likelihood methods for estimation and inference are the climax of the course.  We end the course with a short 
        introduction to nonparametric methods for density estimation and the bootstrap.  The course combines theory, 
        application and simulation throughout in order to motivate the statistical results we rely on in practice.</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href="ma483sample.html">Bayesian Data Analysis (MA483)</a></strong><br>
        This course offers an introduction to inference under the Bayesian framework.  This includes inference about a 
        single sample through generalized linear models.  The course also introduces computational tools for Bayesian
        inference, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.</li>

 	      <li><strong>Applied Regression (MA485)</strong><br>
        This course explores linear regression modeling, which provides a unifying framework for many standard statistical 
        methods.  Regression modeling also provides a foundation for many advanced procedures.  We examine questions that 
        can be addressed through regression modeling such as isolating the effect of a predictor, modeling nonlinear 
        relationships, and allowing for effect modifications.  We also examine the theory (probability and linear algebra 
        primarily) underlying the model.</li>
