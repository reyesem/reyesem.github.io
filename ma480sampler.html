</header>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white">
  <p>One author has referred to Bayesian Inference as "probability in action."  Probability is all about looking forward in time - computing the likelihood of an event occurring given that you know everything about the model (the parameters). In practice, we are often working backward; we have data generated from some process, but we are not fully aware of the model that governs this process. So, we need to use the data to infer something about that process (or population). This is the process of statistical inference.  The Bayesian framework is one approach to statistical inference and prediction that makes use of any prior knowledge available (such as historical information or expert opinions and human judgment).</p>

  <p>This course offers an introduction to inference (making statements about a population of interest using a sample from the population) under the Bayesian framework.  Building from Bayes' rule for probability computations, we develop a framework of estimation and hypothesis testing.  We will examine inference in several scenarios, including the comparison of several means and regression analysis.  Modern applications are covered, time permitting.  In addition, we discuss the construction of encoding available knowledge as distributions (constructing a prior given historical data) and introduce computational tools for Bayesian inference (MCMC methods).</p>

  <p>As with all courses in statistics, we develop statistical literacy and statistical reasoning.  This is accomplished through a mix of problems including analytical work (theorems/proofs) and data analysis.  Throughout the course, we emphasize the <i>application</i> of the statistical approach discussed.  Throughout the course, we build on five fundamental concepts in inference:</p>

  <ol>
 	  <li>Research questions can often be framed in terms of a parameter characterizing the variable of interest within the population.</li>
 	  <li>If data is to be useful for making conclusions about the population, a process referred to as drawing inference, we must consider the method in which the data was collected.</li>
 	  <li>The use of data for decision making requires the data be summarized and presented in ways that address the question of interest.</li>
 	  <li>Variability is inherit in any process, and as a result, the data is subject to sampling variability.  Statistics vary across samples in a predictable way; that is, they have a distribution which can be modeled.</li>
 	  <li>With a model for the distribution of a statistics, we can quantify the strength of evidence against a particular hypothesis or construct an estimate of the parameter which accounts for the variability.  This allows us to draw conclusions about the corresponding parameter.</li>
  </ol>

  <div id="Sample Lecture" class="w3-container city w3-animate-opacity">
    <h2 style="color: #800000">Sample Lecture</h2>

    <p>This is a traditional course in which the instructor "lectures" most days.  However, students are expected to participate in the lecture helping to solve posed problems and add to the classroom discussion.  To reduce the amount of time spent copying a problem and increase the discussion in the class, course notes are provided which correspond to the lecture.  Below is a sample of the course notes which are used to introduce the fundamental ideas of the course.</p>

  <div id="Case Study" class="w3-container city w3-animate-opacity">
    <h2 style="color: #800000">Case Study</h2>

    <p>This course emphasizes the <i>application</i> of the Bayesian framework.  That is, students are exposed to research questions which can be addressed with data.  The primary avenue for this exposure is case studies.  Students will develop a portfolio in which they communicate solutions to applied problems.  By the end of the term, each student will have a collection of assignments which demonstrates their mastery of and ability to communicate the topics in the course.  Below is the question associated with reliability.</p>

    <p><b>Background:</b> Reliability analysis (also termed survival analysis or failure-time analysis) is concerned with modeling and predicting the lifetime of subjects within a population.  Consider a system comprised of four identical components that operate independently of one another.  The components are connected in series; that is, the system continues to operate as long as all components int he system are operational.  Interest is in making inference on the lifetime <i>of the components</i>; however, due to the nature of the system, the components cannot be tested individually.  But, we do have the ability to run the system repeatedly.</p>

    <p>For example, consider a flashlight that is powered by four AA batteries.  The flashlight continues to operate as long as all four batteries have power; if one battery fails, the entire flashlight fails.  I do not have a device to examine batteries individually, and I am too cheap to make/purchase such a device.  So, I conduct the following experiment:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>I load the flashlight with four batteries, turn it on, and record the time at whicht he flashlight goes out.</li>
      <li>After the flashlight goes out, I replace all four batteries with new batteries and repeat the study.</li>
      <li>I perform the experiment \(n\) times, each time recording the lifetime of the flashlight.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A popular model for the lifetime of a subject is the Rayleigh distribution.  Suppose it is reasonable to model the lifetime of batteries using the Rayleigh distribution.  Address the following questions:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Estimate the <i>median</i> lifetime of an <i>individual</i> battery of Brand A.</li>
      <li>Predict the median lifetime of a new Brand A <i>battery</i>.</li>
      <li>Brand A is the cheaper battery; therefore, I would expect it to have a lower lifetime.  Is there evidence to suggest the lifetime of Brand A is less than that of Brand B?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Below is a table of the observed lifetimes (in weeks) for the <i>system</i> using batteres of each brand on \(n = 10\) independent trials.</p>

    <p>The following is an example of a homework question that would accompany a unit which introduces the idea of simulation to approximate a distribution.</p>

    <p><b>Murphey's Law:</b> Suppose you are staying at a downtown hotel and are planning to meet a friend for dinner.  Further, suppose taxis arrive in front of the hotel at random at a rate of about one every 2 minutes (that is, assume the time between taxis follows an Exponential distribution with a mean of 2).  Just as you get outside, you receive a text from your friend saying she will arrive in 10 minutes.  Assume your friend arrives exactly 10 minutes later.  Use a simulation study to address the following questions:</p>

    <ul>
 	  <li>How long, on average, will you have to wait between the cab that arrives just prior to your friend's arrival and the one that arrives just after your friend's arrival?</li>
 	  <li>What is the probability that you wait more than 5 minutes between the two cabs described in the previous part?</li>
 	  <li>Provide a plot of the density of the wait time between the two cabs described above.</li>
    </ul>
