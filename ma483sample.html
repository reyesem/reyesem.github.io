      <p>One author has referred to Bayesian Inference as "probability in action."  Probability is all about looking 
      forward in time - computing the likelihood of an event occurring given that you know everything about the model. In
      practice, we are often working backward; we have data generated from some process, but we are not fully aware of the
      model that governs this process.  The Bayesian framework is one approach to statistical inference that quantifies
      the prior knowledge available about a process through probability distributions.</p>
      
      <p>This course offers an introduction to inference under the Bayesian framework.  Building from Bayes' Rule for 
      probability computations, we develop a framework of estimation and hypothesis testing.  We examine inference in 
      several scenarios, including regression analysis.  Modern applications will be covered, time permitting.  We discuss 
      the construction of prior distributions given prior information about a parameter and give an introduction to 
      computational tools for Bayesian inference, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.</p>
      
      <p>This course is particularly useful for students considering an analytical career, those interested in 
      computational psychology, and those interested in traffic engineering at Rose-Hulman.  This course is unique at
      Rose-Hulman in that our other statistics courses consider inference from a Frequentist perspective.  This course,
      therefore, assumes no prior knowledge of statistics but does assume knowledge of probability.</p>

        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        
        <p>After completing this course, students will be able to accomplish the following tasks:</p>
        
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Given a research goal, <strong>identify</strong> the parameter(s) of interest and, if applicable, 
          <strong>formulate</strong> the goal as measurable statements about the parameter(s) of interest.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Describe</strong> the importance of considering data collection when interpreting the results 
          of a study.  Specifically, <strong>determine</strong> whether it is reasonable that a sample is 
          representative of the underlying population and <strong>justify</strong> your rationale.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Construct</strong> and <strong>interpret</strong> graphical and numerical summaries of 
          data to address a research goal.</li>
          
          <li>Given a description of the data generating process, <strong>construct</strong> a probability model 
          that represents that process as a function of unknown parameters.</li>
          
          <li>Given a question of interest, <strong>construct</strong> a probability distribution that captures the 
          information on the parameter prior to conducting the study, and use the data to <strong>update</strong> 
          the information on the parameter.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Comment</strong> on the adequacy of a statistical method for addressing a given question of 
          interest by <strong>assessing</strong> the assumptions underlying the method.</li>
          
          <li>Given a posterior distribution, <strong>summarize</strong> the uncertainty in the parameter of interest 
          and <strong>interpret</strong> the resulting output in context of the research question.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Identify</strong> the value of statistical methodology in the advancement of science as well as 
          <strong>recognize</strong> its limitations.</li>
          
          <li>Clearly <strong>communicate</strong> an analysis and its implications in written format.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Describe</strong> the role of probability theory in the Bayesian framework for making inference 
          on a population and <strong>appreciate</strong> the use of probability for capturing uncertainty about a 
          parameter and the use of data to inform that uncertainty.</li>

        <h3>Course Structure</h3>
        
        <p>This course is given as a traditional lecture class.  The course is divided into the following modules:</p>
        
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Statistical Process</li>
          <li>Bayesian Fundamentals</li>
          <li>Bayesian Computations</li>
          <li>Comparing Groups</li>
          <li>Regression</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Instead of exams, each module is accompanied by a lengthy homework assignment and applied analysis task.
        These tasks pose a problem in a specific context and ask you to use the available data to address the problem.
        These focus on both the implementation as well as communication of the solution.</p>

        <p>The course is mostly delivered with course notes.  However, as an introduction for those who have not
        had prior exposure to statistics, I recommend 
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/purchase">Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond a handful of classic examples, the Bayesian framework requires specialized computing tools.  The
        class makes use of Stan through the <code>rstan</code> package in R.  While R is supported, students have had 
        success implenting Stan in Python.</p>
