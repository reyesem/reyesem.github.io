      <p>The biological sciences often yield datasets which present unique challenges to data analysis.  This course 
      introduces these challenges and the statistical methods employed to overcome them.  We begin with an introduction 
      to the use of statistical regression models and then explore how such models can be extended to account for 
      various features of the data collection process and question of interest.  This could include non-linear 
      relationships, categorical response variables, censored survival (or reliability) data, and repeated measurements 
      on the same subject.  Other topics discussed as time permits include pooling results from multiple studies, 
      handling missing data, study design and power, and drawing causal conclusions from observational data.</p>
      
      <p>The course is not meant to provide an in-depth statistical treatment of these topics, but instead aims to 
      enable students to evaluate the strength of evidence presented in the literature within their field of study.  
      Largely driven by small projects analyzing real data, the course focuses on identifying when the application of 
      these techniques is warranted and interpreting the results produces by these methods (such as those found in the 
      medical literature).</p>
      
      <p>A unique feature of the course is critiquing literature from the biological sciences.  We discuss the various
      standards for presenting statistical analysis in discipline-specific literature.  We also explore many common
      misconceptions.  This class is ideal for students further developing their statistical background (as it is truly
      a course in statistical modeling) and students in the biological sciences (Biology, Biomedical Engineering, and
      Biochemistry) wanting to broaden their statistical toolkit and improve their ability to critique the literature.</p>

        <p>More than many other courses, this course focuses on communication.  Many of the activities and 
        assessments in the course are designed to practice interpreting analyses and communicating rich concepts
        underlying them.  Specifically, after taking this course, students will be able to accomplish the following
        tasks:</p>
        
        <ol type="A">
          <li><strong>Describe</strong> situations for which mulit-predictor regression models are needed to address 
          the research question of interest.  Specifically, <strong>describe</strong> the role multi-predictor regression 
          models play in isolating the effect of a variable and investigating the interplay between multiple variables.</li>
          
          <li>Given an analysis situation, <strong>state</strong> the appropriate regression modeling technique (linear, 
          non-linear, survival, or repeated measures) and <strong>justify</strong> your choice.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Formulate</strong> research questions as measurable statements about parameters in a regression 
          model.</li>
          
          <li>Given a research question from the biological sciences, use appropriate software to 
          <strong>conduct</strong> inference on the corresponding parameters and <strong>interpret</strong> the resulting 
          output in context of the research question.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Compare</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong> the four primary regression modeling techniques 
          discussed: linear, non-linear, survival, repeated measures.</li>
          
          <li>Clearly <strong>communicate</strong> an analysis and its implications using a variety of media: written paper, 
          scientific poster, scientific abstract, and oral presentation.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Collaborate</strong> with others to formulate a statistical analysis plan for addressing a research 
          question.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Appreciate</strong> the value and limitations of regression modeling for addressing research questions 
          in the biological sciences.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Express</strong> a desire for researchers in the biological sciences to be trained in statistical 
          thinking and literacy.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Assess</strong> the strength of evidence presented by a scientific publication in addressing a
          research question and <strong>provide</strong> constructive feedback for improving a study.</li>

        <h3>Course Structure</h3>
        
        <p>This class is offered as a hybrid course, meaning that much of the content is delivered remotely through 
        readings and video lectures.  Class time will be used to host discussions which illuminate the concepts in the 
        course, discussions on the literature, and to work additional examples in a group setting.</p>
        
        <p>The course is a modeling course; beginning with foundational modeling, we see how most common questions can
        be embedded into a statistical model for study.  The course has the following four modules:</p>
        
        <ol type="1">
          <li><strong>General Linear Model</strong>: The general linear model, also referred to as multiple linear 
          regression, provides a framework appropriate for modeling a continuous outcome (response) as a function of 
          several predictors (covariates).  This module serves as a unifying framework to the topics discussed in an 
          introductory statistics course.  It also provides a platform for introducing several flexible modeling 
          strategies.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Repeated Measures</strong>: When the response is measured at multiple times on the same subject, 
          we refer to this as repeated measures.  This induces a correlation structure among the responses that violates
          the assumption of independence often made during an analysis.  This correlation structure must be addressed in 
          the modelling stage if the standard errors produced are to be relied upon.  Further, careful consideration of 
          the study design and use of such analyses can improve the power of a study to address a particular question of 
          interest.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Nonlinear Models</strong>: Models which are nonlinear in the parameters have applications to cellular 
          biology, ecology, chemical engineering, and more broadly when modeling categorical data (such as when the response 
          is binary).  Embedding nonlinear models into a statistical framework allows us to make inference on the underlying 
          parameters.  In this unit, we examine such models and discuss logistic regression in particular.  We also discuss 
          extensions to repeated measures data and touch on model selection for nonlinear regression models.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Survival Analysis</strong>: Many studies involve studying the time until an event occurs.  Unfortunately, 
          in biological settings, the event is often not observed for all subjects, a phenomena referred to as censoring.  In 
          this module, we examine methods for addressing censored data.  In particular, we look at nonparametric approaches 
          leading up to the Cox Proportional Hazards model, an extension of regression which accounts for the censoring.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The last few days of the course are reserved for activities to tie the units together as well as cover topics
        of specific student interest.  The class thrives on discussion more than most that I teach.</p>

        <p>The course makes use primarily of a course note packet, but I also refer to <em>Regression Methods in 
        Biostatistics: Linear, Logistic, Survival, and Repeated Measures Models</em> (Vittinghoff et. al.) 
        throughout the course.  The course is interesting in that many biostatistics courses are introductory courses
        in statistics or are specialized topics courses.  This course is a secondary course in statistics focusing
        on modeling within a biological setting.</p>
        
        <p>The course makes use of R as the statistical computing environment.  This is necessary for some additional
        functionality used throughout the term.  Example code is given to students throughout the term; the goal is not
        to make students "programmers" but to introduce you to a tool for statistical analysis and communication.</p>
