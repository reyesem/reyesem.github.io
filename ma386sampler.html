  <p>Computational data analysis is an essential part of modern statistics.  This course introduces tools and strategies for data management, manipulation and analysis that are common in statistics and data science.  These skills will be developed primarily through the R computing language.  In addition to working with data, we will build upon the foundation set in the introductory course regarding statistical literacy and reasoning.</p>
  
  <p>This is not a programming course, but a computing course.  That is, we want to introduce tools that allow you to think with data.  As a result, there are a variety of assignments throughout the term to help you turn data into information and convey that information to a potential researcher or client.</p>

  <div id="Sample Lecture" class="w3-container city w3-animate-opacity">
    <h2 style="color: #800000">Sample Lecture</h2>
    
    <p>This course is run as a workshop.  Half of each week is spent in traditional "lecture" and working examples as a large group.  The other half of each week is spent working on extended case studies which make use of the material from the lecture.  I am a firm believer that you learn to work with data by actually working with data; therefore, I give you plenty of time to get your hands messy in an environment where you can work with others and the instructor to solve the issues you encounter.  This also allows us to cover a large amount of material over the course of the term.  Below is a sample of the course notes discussing Dynamic Graphics, a follow-up to the module on static data visualization.</p>

  <div id="Case Study" class="w3-container city w3-animate-opacity">
    <h2 style="color: #800000">Portfolio Assignment</h2>
    
    <p>In addition to computational approaches to working with data, this course emphasizes the communication those approaches.  That is, students are exposed to real-world problems for which they will use suggested data to address a research question.  This may involve scraping the data from a website, cleaning it, and then applying an appropriate visualization to address the question.  The primary avenue for this exposure is through case studies.  Students will develop a portfolio in which they communicate solutions to applied problems.  By the end of the term, each student will have a collection of assignments which demonstrates their mastery of and ability to communicate computational approaches discussed in the course in an applied setting.  Below is a question that might be associated with unit on data input (web scraping).</p>
    
    <p>Terre Haute, Indiana is a small college town, home to both Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology as well as Indiana State University (Saint Mary's of the Woods is located in nearby West Terre Haute).  The city is home to approximately 61,000 individuals with a median household income of $33,317 (based on 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey).  As with many college towns, the city draws many popular retail chains.</p>
    
    <p>Prior to 2015, K-Mart and Walmart each had a presence in the city.  Following the opening of a Meier in the summer of 2015, K-Mart closed its Terre Haute location.  Rumors immediately swirled that Target was considering moving into the vacated building, which most residents would welcome.  However, there has been a long-held belief (and widely circulated rumor) that Target would not open a store in Terre Haute because the median income of the city is not high enough.  If such a standard exists, and Terre Haute does indeed fall below this standard, we are not likely to see Target invest in a local branch without incentives.  We are interested in determining if such a rumor is plausible.</p>
    
    <p>The American Community Survey is conducted annually (as opposed to the US census which occurs every few years).  The US Census Bureau uses the survey to provide estimated characteristics for various regions.  In addition to population estimates, median household income is available.  This data can be obtained using the FactFinder application on the US Census Bureau website.  The locations of all Target stores in the US is available online from various websites.  We are interested in combining these two data sources in order to assess whether the data supports the rumors that Target only places stores in locations above some threshold income level, and where Terre Haute might fall with respect to such a boundary.</p>
    
    <p>Using the data from these sources, comment on the rumor that Terre Haute does not meet the minimum median household income for Target to consider opening a location in the city.  You should construct some type of graphic to support your conclusions.</p>

  <div id="Example Assessment Item" class="w3-container city w3-animate-opacity">
    <h2 style="color: #800000">Programming Task</h2>
    
    <p>In addition to the more extended problems presented in the portfolio assignments, weekly programming tasks are provided to practice key skills covered within the module.  An example of such a task, assessing skills with the various data structures within R is given below.</p>
    
    <p>Arguably, one of the busiest transportation hubs world-wide is New York City (NYC).  Hundreds of flights depart the city on a daily basis.  We will be looking at data for all flights departing NYC in 2013.  This data is available in the "nycflights13" package in R.  How many flights departed from NYC during the month of June 2013?  What is the tail number of the last flight departing from NYC during the month of July 2013?</p>
