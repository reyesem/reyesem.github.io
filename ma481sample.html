      <p>This course introduces students to the analytical tools needed to establish the properties of common statistical
      methods.  Why do sampling distributions of many statistics become bell-shaped with large sample sizes?  When is the
      sample mean the best estimator for the population mean?  What do we mean by "best" estimator?</p>
      
      <p>This course takes a likelihood-based perspective to provide a unified framework to estimation and hypothesis 
      testing.  Building a proper foundation for inference, we emphasize the <em>application of theory</em> throughout 
      the course.  In additional to classical theory, the course makes use of computing as a bridge between that 
      classical theory and the modern approaches used characterize statistical methods.</p>
      
      <p>The class builds towards preparing students to engage in the statistics literature at an introductory level.
      This class is particularly suited for those students considering graduate level work in statistics.  It does 
      require a firm grasp of probability.</p>

        <p>As in any statistics course, we emphasize statistical literacy and reasoning.  This class also emphasizes
        the underlying theory of statistical methodology.  Specifically, after taking this course, students will be 
        able to accomplish the following tasks:</p>
        
        <ol type="A">
          <li><strong>Describe</strong> the role of probability theory when making inference on a population.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Compare</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong> modes of convergence and <strong>describe</strong> 
          their role in sampling distributions.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Construct</strong> a proof to establish a property of an estimator or sequence of random 
          variables.</li>
          
          <li>Given an analysis situation, <strong>formulate</strong> research questions as measurable statements 
          about parameters in the population.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Associate</strong> a given statistical method with various statistical properties such as 
          consistency, unbiasedness, and asymptotic normality.</li>
          
          <li>Clearly <strong>communicate</strong> statistical theory and its applications through both written and 
          oral presentations.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Appreciate</strong> the use of mathematics in statistical theory and <strong>compare</strong> 
          and <strong>contrast</strong> mathematical and statistical thinking.</li>
          
          <li>Using fundamental ideas of convergence, likelihood, and probability, <strong>research</strong> a topic 
          in statistical theory not discussed in the course and <strong>educate</strong> your peers on the topic.</li>

        <h3>Course Structure</h3>
        
        <p>This course is currently taught as a traditional lecture.  The course is divided into 10 modules. Each
        module has associated assignments.  For each module, students can expect three lectures which illustrate
        foundational concepts in the course.  One class period is reserved within each module for a group activity
        in which students work together to fill out a theoretical result associated with the material.  The modules
        covered include:</p>
        
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Essential Probability for Random Vectors</li>
          <li>Expectations</li>
          <li>Multivariate Normality and Linear Models</li>
          <li>Point Estimation</li>
          <li>Sampling Distributions</li>
          <li>Inference from a Likelihood Perspective</li>
          <li>Introduction to Nonparametric Estimation</li>
          <li>Introduction to Bootstrap Theory</li>
          <li>Introduction to Bayesian Inference</li>
          <li>Capstone Project</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The best part of the class is the <em>Capstone Project</em>.  Over the course of the term, we cover
        quite a bit of material regarding the theory underlying many statistical methods.  However, there are
        countless fascinating topics we will leave untouched.  The capstone project invites students to
        explore an additional area in foundational statistics and present a lecture to their peers on the
        topic.  This is often a great celebration of the knowledge gained during the term.</p>

        <p>I have not settled on a text for this course and have tried out several.  I do supplement the text used 
        with note packets used during lecture and in-class activities.</p>
        
        <p>Statistical computation is a big part of the course; while R is demonstrated and supported, students are
        free to use any computational software they like (Python, Julia, Matlab).</p>
        
        <p>Some students think of this class as "real analysis for statistics," but that is not quite accurate.  
        However, there is quite a bit of theory and proofs in the class.  The best resource in a class like this are
        your peers.  I will provide additional tips and tools throughout, but it is highly recommended to enter the
        class thinking about who you might work with throughout the course.</p>
