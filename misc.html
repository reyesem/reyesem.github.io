<div class="w3-padding w3-white">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Specifications Grading: </strong><em>The passion I had for teaching was being killed by the dread I continuously faced with grading and worse, handing back the graded assignments.  I found the after-grade encounters often antagonistic and more often related to winning back points than understanding the lessons to be learned from the experience.</em>  That is a quote from Linda Nilson's book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Specifications-Grading-Restoring-Motivating-Students/dp/1620362422">Specifications Grading: Restoring Rigor, Motivating Students, and Saving Faculty Time</a></em>.  Along with several colleagues at Rose-Hulman, I read through the book and decided to implement Nilson's method for student assessment.  Given the increase in the quality of work my students have produced, I will never go back!  Since adopting Specifications Grading in my courses, I led a workshop in 2017 at the US Conference on Teaching Statistics introducing the topic and providing tips for getting started.  The workbook for participants in the workshop, which is based on Nilson's text, is available by <a href="./files/USCOTS2017.pdf">clicking here</a>.</li><br>

    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/reyesem/Latex-Templates">LaTeX Templates</a>: </strong>There are several documents faculty construct regularly, including slide presentations, poster presentations, and official letters.  This link is to a GitHub repository which contains templates for creating materials which adhere to the Rose-Hulman branding guidelines using LaTeX.</li>

<!-- Interesting Statistics Links -->

  <h3>Interesting Statistics Links</h3>
</header>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white">
  <ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/programs/sibs/">SIBS Program</a>: </strong>The Summer Institute for Training in Biostatistics (SIBS) program is a wonderful glimpse into the world of biostatistics.  This program is intended for undergraduate students of any major with an interest in learning how statistics plays a role in the medical world.  I attended this program in the summer of 2005 at North Carolina State University.  This program played a large role in my decision to attend graduate school, study at North Carolina State University, and concentrate in biostatistics.  In addition, this is where I met my wife!</li><br>

 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.causeweb.org/">CAUSEweb</a>: </strong>This website has become a new favorite.  It is a great resource for statistics education.  This includes access to activities, workshops, and articles regarding statistics education.</li><br>

 	<li><strong>Conferences: </strong>There are some really great conferences out there.  Here are a few of my favorite: <a href="http://www.enar.org/">ENAR</a> focuses on biostatistics, and provides some great short courses on learning the latest methods for addressing the statistical issues that arise in medical research.  <a href="http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm.cfm">JSM</a> is the largest gathering of statisticians in one place. <a href="http://www.mbswonline.com/">MBSW</a> is a conference local to Indiana; though small, this conference remains relevant to statisticians interested in biostatistics - particularly the biopharmaceutical world.  <a href="http://www.causeweb.org/uscots/">USCOTS</a> is a conference on teaching statistics; while only held during odd years, an online version is held during even years and an international version occurs every few years.  This has become my favorite conference as the atmosphere is amazing.</li><br>

<!-- Additional Stuff -->
<header class="w3-container w3-rhitred">
  <h3>The Good Stuff</h3>
</header>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white">
  <ul>
 	<li><strong>Family: </strong>I have been blessed with a wonderful family.  My wife (Jamie) and I were married in 2006, shortly after receiving our undergraduate degrees.  We make a great team - both being statisticians, we attended graduate school together and both received our Master of Statistics Degree, with a concentration in biostatistics, from North Carolina State University.  We studied together then, and she continues to be an invaluable resource when it comes to writing exams, grading, and bouncing ideas off someone when I am doing research.  After graduate school, she went on to work for several years at BD Technologies aiding in cellular biology research before choosing to become a stay-at-home-mom when our first daughter was born.  Our oldest daughter was born in early 2012, and has the sweetest demeanor and can often be found with a book.  Our second daughter was born during a snowstorm in early 2014 (that's a story in and of itself).  She is a little ball of energy who is eager to share what is on her mind (probably at the top of her lungs).</li><br>

 	<li><strong>InterVarsity: </strong> I was a part of the <a href="http://roseiv.org/">Rose-Hulman chapter of InterVarsity</a> (IV) throughout my undergraduate career.  Now that I am back on campus, I enjoy serving the chapter as the faculty advisor.  This Christian group is dedicated to seeing lives transformed through the power of the gospel.</li><br>

 	<li><strong>Church: </strong>We have decided to call <a href="http://www.worldgospelchurch.org/">World Gospel Church</a> home.  Perhaps the thing we enjoy most about this church is the ability to worship as a family, which we find to be extremely valuable, both for us and our children.</li>
