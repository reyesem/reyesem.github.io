    <article id="waterfootprintlab-overview" class="primary-article"> 
           
      <p>During the 2023-2024 academic year, Rose-Hulman supported a network of faculty interested in injecting sustainability concepts throughout the curriculum.  
      In collaboration with Jamie Reyes, we developed a lab for an introductory statistics course that allowed students to (a) practice skills learned in class 
      associated with performing inference about the parameters of a regression model and (b) introduced students to the concept of virtual water and water 
      footprints.</p>

    <!--Water Values -->
    <article id="waterfootprintlab-answers" class="primary-article">
      <p>As a component of the lab activity, we asked students to state the amount of water (gallons) they believe is required to produce several common items.  
      We then provided a short education on the amount of water required to produce one serving (4 oz) of apple.  Students were then asked to repeat the activity.
      Below are the estimated water requirements (gallons) for those items:</p>

      <p>Below are course materials associated with this lab.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href='./files/waterfootprintlab/Poster.pdf'>Poster Presentation</a></strong><br>
        This poster summarizing the project was presented to other members of the sustainability network at Rose-Hulman.</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href='./files/waterfootprintlab/Lab-Introduction.pdf'>Instructor Notes for Introducing Water Footprints</a></strong><br>
        The lab is introduced to students during class.  This provides notes for the instructor on how to motivate the need for
        water conservation, and the need to characterize water use if we are to consider water conservation efforts.</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href='./files/waterfootprintlab/Lab-Background.pdf'>Additional Background for Students</a></strong><br>
        The lab is introduced to students during class.  This includes both a discussion of "virtual" water, water footprints, the
        utility of surveys, and the format of the lab report itself.  Following the class discussion, this document is provided to 
        students to support that discussion on water footprints.</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href='./files/waterfootprintlab/Survey.pdf'>Survey</a></strong><br>
        Each student completes a survey in class.  The survey includes the following sections:
        <ul>
          <li>Demographic information: basic (non-identifying) demographic information is collected.  This includes age and
          political affiliations that may be used to characterize water use.</li>
          <li>Perceived water use: asks students to estimate their water use, describe some behaviors associated with 
          water use, and estimate the water required to produce common products.</li>
          <li>Education: a short paragraph is provided regarding "virtual" water in the production of apples. Participants
          are then asked to re-estimate the water required to produce common products (same set). This allows for investigation
          of the impact of the education on student perception of virtual water.</li>
          <li>Water Footprint: participants are redirected to an online water calculator to estimate and then report their
          water footprint.</li>
        </ul></li>
        
        <li><strong><a href='./files/waterfootprintlab/Lab-Instructions.pdf'>Instructions for Lab Report</a></strong><br>
        Students work in groups to address a question of interest using the available data.  Each group is responsible for 
        determining their research question, conducting an analysis, and presenting the results.  The report consists of 
        answering the attached questions. Note that these prompts are not specific to this particular context of water
        conservation.  This report assesses the statistical skills learned in the course.</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href='./files/waterfootprintlab/Lab-Reflection.pdf'>Student Reflection</a></strong><br>
        To assess the impact of the context of the lab on student perceptions regarding water conservation, students complete
        a reflection exercise.  The attached questions were graded on completion.  These align with the UN Sustainability Goals
        learning outcomes and internal Institute learning outcomes.</li>
