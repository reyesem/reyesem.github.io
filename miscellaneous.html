        <li><strong><a href="http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/programs/sibs/">SIBS Program</a>: </strong>
        The Summer Institute for Training in Biostatistics (SIBS) program is a wonderful glimpse into the world of biostatistics.  This program is intended for undergraduate 
        students of any major with an interest in learning how statistics plays a role in the medical world.  I attended this program in the summer of 2005 at North Carolina 
        State University.  This program played a large role in my decision to attend graduate school, study at North Carolina State University, and concentrate in biostatistics.  
        In addition, this is where I met my wife!</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href="http://www.causeweb.org/">CAUSEweb</a>: </strong>
        This website has become a favorite.  It is a great resource for statistics education.  This includes access to activities, workshops, and articles regarding statistics 
        education.</li>
        
        <li><strong><a href="https://community.amstat.org/isolatedstatisticians/home">Isolated Statisticians</a>: </strong>
        Known mostly for the listserv, this community of statisticians has been an abundant source of ideas for the classroom as well as tips on professional growth.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Conferences: </strong>
        There are some really great conferences out there.  Here are a few of my favorite: <a href="http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm.cfm">JSM</a> is the largest gathering of 
        statisticians in one place. <a href="https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/">USCOTS</a> is a conference on teaching statistics (held during odd years). 
        <a href="https://www.causeweb.org/cause/ecots/">eCOTS</a> is the electronic version of USCOTS (held during even years); if you have an interest in remote education,
        this is a great conference to see examples of engagine students in a remote environment.  <a href="https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/eusrc">Electronic Undergraduate
        Statistics Research Conference</a> is aimed at undergraduate students with work presented by undergraduate students; held virtually, this is a great place to get a 
        sense of what the statistics community has to offer. </li>

      <h2>The Good Stuff</h2>
      
      <h4>Family</h4>
      <p>I have been blessed with a wonderful family.  My wife (Jamie) and I were married in 2006, shortly after receiving our undergraduate degrees.  We make a great team; we are 
      both statisticians and attended graduate school together.  We studied together then, and she continues to be an invaluable resource when it comes to course development and 
      bouncing ideas off someone when I am doing research.  After graduate school, she went on to work for several years at BD Technologies aiding in cellular biology research before 
      choosing to become a stay-at-home-mom when our first daughter was born.  Our oldest daughter was born in early 2012, and has the sweetest demeanor and can often be found with a book.  
      Our second daughter was born during a snowstorm in early 2014 (that's a story in and of itself).  She is a little ball of energy who is eager to share what is on her mind (probably at 
      the top of her lungs).</p>
      
      <h4>InterVarsity</h4>
      <p>I was a part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rose-hulman-ivcf/">Rose-Hulman chapter of InterVarsity</a> (IV) throughout my undergraduate career.  Now that I am 
      back on campus, I enjoy serving the chapter as the faculty advisor.  This Christian group is dedicated to seeing every corner of campus transformed through the power of the gospel.</p>
      
      <h4>Sailing</h4>
      <p>In 2018, I got into sailing.  For those in the area, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.lakemonroesailing.com/">Lake Monroe Sailing Association</a>.  There is no better 
      deal in the state than getting certified on their small boat fleet, and it is a great way to get into sailing.  We now have a 14.5 foot daysailer, which I enjoy taking out whenever
      I have an opportunity.</p>
