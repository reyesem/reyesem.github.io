<p>Consider again the goal of statistical inference — to use a sample as a snapshot to say something about the underlying population (Figure <a href="Data.html#fig:data-statistical-process">5.1</a>). This generally provokes unease in people, leading to a distrust of statistical results. In this section we attack that distrust head on.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> What Makes a Sample Reliable</h2>
<p>If we are going to have some amount of faith in the statistical results we produce, we must have data in which we can place our trust. <em>The Treachery of Images</em> (Figure <a href="Data.html#fig:data-pipe-img">5.2</a>) is a canvas painting depicting a pipe, below which the artist wrote the French phrase “This is not a pipe.” Regarding the painting, the artist said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it’s just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture “This is a pipe,” I’d have been lying!</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Just as a painting is a representation of the object it depicts, so a sample should be a representation of the population under study. This is the primary requirement if we are to rely on the resulting data.</p>

<div class="rmdkeyidea">
In order for a statistical analysis to be reliable, the sample must be <em>representative</em> of the population under study.
</div>
<p>We need to be careful to not get carried away in our expectations. What constitutes “representative” really depends on the question, just as an artist chooses his depiction based on how he wants to represent the object. Let’s consider the following example.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:data-school-debt" class="example"><strong>Example 5.1  (School Debt) </strong></span>In addition to a degree, college graduates also tend to leave with a large amount of debt due to college loans. In 2012, a graduate with a student loan had an average debt of $29,400; for graduates from private non-profit institutions, the average debt was $32,300[^debt].</p>
<p>Suppose we are interested in determining the average amount of debt in student loans carried by a graduating senior from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, a small private non-profit engineering school. There are many faculty at Rose-Hulman who choose to send their children to the institute. Since I am also on the faculty, I know many of these individuals. Suppose I were to ask each to report the amount of student loans their children carried upon graduation from Rose-Hulman. I compile the 25 responses and compute the average amount of debt. Further, I report that based on this study, there is significant evidence that the average debt carried by a graduate of Rose-Hulman is far below the $32,300 reported above (great news for this year’s graduating class)! Why might we be hesitant to trust these results?</p>
</div>
<p>Many objections to statistical results stem from a distrust of whether the data (the sample) is really representative of the population of interest. Rose-Hulman, like many other universities, has a policy that the children of faculty may attend their university (assuming admittance) tuition-free. We would therefore expect their children to carry much less debt than the typical graduating senior. There is a mismatch between the group we would like to study and the data we have collected.</p>
<p>This example provides a nice backdrop for discussing what it means to be representative. First, let’s define our population; in this case, we are interested in graduating seniors from Rose-Hulman. The variable of interest is the amount of debt carried in student loans; the parameter of interest is then the <em>average</em> amount of debt in student loans carried by graduating seniors of Rose-Hulman. However, the sample consists of only graduating seniors of Rose-Hulman who have a parent employeed by the university.</p>
<p>With regard to the grade point average of the students in our sample, it is probably similar to all graduating seniors. The starting salary of the students in our sample is probably similar to all graduating seniors; the fraction of mechanical engineering majors versus math majors is probably similar. So, in many regards the sample is representative of the population; however, it fails to be representative with regard to the variable of interest. This is our concern. The amount of debt carried by students in our sample is not representative of that debt carried by all graduating seniors from the university.</p>

<div class="rmdtip">
When thinking about whether a sample is representative, focus your attention to the characteristics specific to your research question.
</div>
<p>Does that mean the sample is useless? Yes and no. The sample collected cannot be used to answer our initial question of interest. No statistical method can fix bad data; statistics adheres to the “garbage-in, garbage-out” phenomena. If the data is bad, no analysis will undo that. However, while the sample cannot be used to answer our initial question, it could be used to address a different question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the average amount of debt in student loans carried by graduating seniors from Rose-Hulman whose parent is a faculty member at the university?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this revised question, the sample may indeed be representative. If we are working with previously collected data, we must consider the population to which our results will generalize. That is, for what population is the given sample representative? If we are collecting our data, we need to be sure we collect data in such a way that the data is representative of our target population. Let’s first look at what <em>not</em> to do.</p>
</div>
<div id="poor-methods-of-data-collection" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Poor Methods of Data Collection</h2>
<p>Example <a href="Data.html#exm:data-school-debt">5.1</a> is an example of a “convenience sample,” when the subjects in the sample are chosen simply due to ease of collection. Examples include surveying students only in your sorority when you are interested in all females who are part of a sorority on campus; taking soil samples from only your city when you are interested in the soil for the entire state; and, obtaining measurements from only one brand of phone, because it was the only one you could afford on your budget, when you are interested in studying all cell phones on the market. A convenience sample is unlikely to be representative if there is a relationship between the ease of collection and the variable under study. This was true in the School Debt example; the relationship of a student to a faculty member was directly related to the amount of debt they carried. As a result, the resulting sample was not representative of the population.</p>
<p>When conducting a survey with human subjects, it is common to only illicit responses from volunteers. Such “volunteer samples” tend to draw in those with extreme opinions. Consider product ratings on Amazon. Individual ratings tend to cluster around 5’s and 1’s. This is because those customers who take time to submit a review (which is voluntary) tend to be those who are really thrilled with their product (and want to encourage others to purchase it) and those who are really disappointed with their purchase (and want to encourage others to avoid it). Such surveys often fail to capture those individuals in the population who have “middle of the road” opinions.</p>
<p>We could not possibly name all the poor methods for collecting a sample; but, poor methods all share something in common — it is much more likely the resulting sample is not representative. Failing to be representative results in <strong>biased</strong> estimates of the parameter.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-bias" class="definition"><strong>Definition 5.1  (Bias) </strong></span>A set of measurements is said to be biased if they are <em>consistently</em> too high (or too low). Similarly, an estimate of a parameter is said to be biased if it is <em>consistently</em> too high (or too low).</p>
</div>
<p>To illustrate the concept of bias, consider shooting at a target as in Figure <a href="Data.html#fig:data-bias">5.3</a>. We can consider the center of our target to be the parameter we would like to estimate within the population. The values in our sample (the strikes on the target) will vary around the parameter; while we do not expect any one value to hit the target precisely, a “representative” sample is one in which the values tend to be clustered about the parameter (unbiased). When the sample is not representative, the values in the sample tend to cluster off the mark (biased). Notice that to be unbiased, it may be that not a single value in the sample is perfect, but aggregated together, they point in the right direction. So, bias is not about an individual measurement being an “outlier,” (more on those in a later chapter) but about repeatedly shooting in the wrong direction.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:data-bias"></span>
<img src="images/Data-Bias.jpg" alt="Illustration of bias and variability." width="480" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.3: Illustration of bias and variability.
</p>
</div>

<div class="rmdwarning">
There is a difference between <em>accuracy</em> and <em>precision</em>. Generally, <em>accuracy</em> refers to location (and therefore bias); we say a process is accurate when it is unbiased. <em>Precision</em> refers to the variability.
</div>

<div class="rmdkeyidea">
Biased results are typically due to poor sampling methods that result in a sample which is not representative of the target population.
</div>
<p>The catch (there is always a catch) is that we will never <em>know</em> if a sample is actually representative or not. We can, however, employ methods that help to minimize the chance that the sample is biased.</p>
</div>
<div id="preferred-methods-of-sampling" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Preferred Methods of Sampling</h2>
<p>No method guarantees a perfectly representative sample; but, we can take measures to reduce or eliminate bias. A useful strategy is to employ <em>randomization</em>.</p>

<div class="rmdfivefund">
If data is to be useful for making conclusions about the population, a process referred to as drawing inference, proper data collection is crucial. Randomization can play an important role ensuring a sample is representative and that inferential conclusions are appropriate.
</div>
<p>Consider the School Debt example again. Suppose instead of the strategy described there, we had done the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We constructed a list of all graduating seniors from the university. We placed the name of each student on an index card; then, we thoroughly shuffled the cards and chose the top 25 cards. For these 25 individuals, we recorded the amount of debt in student loans each carried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially describes using a lottery to select the sample. This popular method is known as taking a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. By conducting a lottery, we make it very unlikely that our sample consists of only students with a very small amount of student debt (as occurred when we used a convenience sample).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-simple-random-sample" class="definition"><strong>Definition 5.2  (Simple Random Sample) </strong></span>Often abbreviated SRS, this is a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that <em>every</em> collection of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is equally likely to be the resulting sample. This is equivalent to a lottery.</p>
</div>
<p>There are situations in which a simple random sample does not suffice. Again, consider our School Debt example. The Rose-Hulman student body is predominantly domestic, with only about 3% of the student body being international students. But, suppose we are interested in comparing the average debt carried between international and domestic students. It is very likely, by chance alone, that in a simple random sample of 25 students none will be international. Instead of a simple random sample, we might consider taking a sample of 13 domestic students and a sample of 12 international students; this is an example of a <strong>stratified random sample</strong>. This approach is useful when there is a natural grouping of interest within the population.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-stratified-random-sample" class="definition"><strong>Definition 5.3  (Stratified Random Sample) </strong></span>A sample in which the population is first divided into groups, or strata, based on a characteristic of interest; a simple random sample is then taken within each group.</p>

<p>There are countless sampling techniques used in practice. The two described above can be very useful starting points for developing a custom method suitable for a particular application. Their benefit stems from their use of randomization.</p>
<p>This section is entitled “Preferred Methods” because while these methods are ideal, they are not always practical. Consider the <a href="CaseDeepwater.html#CaseDeepwater">Deepwater Horizon Case Study</a>; conceptually, we can take a simple random sample of the volunteers for our study. However, as with any study involving human subjects, researchers would be required to obtain consent from each subject in the study. That is, a volunteer has the right to refuse to participate in the study. Therefore, it is unlikely that a simple random sample as described above could be obtained. Again, the key is to obtain a <em>representative</em> sample; while random selection may be a nice tool for accomplishing this, we may need to appeal to the composition of the sample itself to justify its use. <em>Based on the characteristics of those willing to participate in the study, do we feel the study participants form a representative group of all volunteers?</em> That is the essential question. This is often why studies report a table summarizing subject demographics such as age, gender, etc. It is also why it is extremely important for researchers to describe how subjects were selected so that readers may make the judgement for themselves whether the sample is representative.</p>
