<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Presenting the Evidence (Summarizing Data)</h1>
<p>If you open any search engine and look up “data visualization,” you will quickly be overwhelmed by a host of pages, texts, and software filled with tools for summarizing your data. Here is the bottom line: a good visualization is one that helps you answer your question of interest. It is both that simple and that complicated.</p>

<div class="rmdfivefund">
The use of data for decision making requires that the data be summarized and presented in ways that address the question of interest.
</div>
<p>Whether simple or complex, all graphical and numerical summaries should help turn the data into usable information. Pretty pictures for the sake of pretty pictures are not helpful. In this section, we will consider various simple graphical and numerical summaries to help build a case for addressing the question of interest.</p>
<div id="characteristics-of-a-distribution-summarizing-a-single-variable" class="section level2" number="6.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Characteristics of a Distribution (Summarizing a Single Variable)</h2>
<p>Remember that because of <em>variability</em>, the key to asking good questions is to not ask questions about individual values but to characterize the underlying <em>distribution</em> (see Definition <a href="Questions.html#def:defn-distribution">4.3</a>). Therefore, characterizing the underlying distribution is also the key to a good visualization or numeric summary. For the <a href="CaseDeepwater.html#CaseDeepwater">Deepwater Horizon Case Study</a>, the response (whether a volunteer experienced adverse respiratory symptoms) is categorical. As we stated previously, summarizing the distribution of a categorical variable reduces to showing how individual subjects fall into the various groups. Figure <a href="Summaries.html#fig:summaries-deepwater-barchart">6.1</a> displays a <em>bar chart</em> summarizing the rate of respiratory symptoms for volunteers cleaning wildlife.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:summaries-deepwater-barchart"></span>
<img src="images/summaries-deepwater-barchart-1.png" alt="Frequency of adverse respiratory symptoms for volunteers cleaning wildlife following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 6.1: Frequency of adverse respiratory symptoms for volunteers cleaning wildlife following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
</p>
</div>
<p>In general, it does not matter whether the frequency or the relative frequencies are reported; however, if the relative frequencies are plotted, some indication of the sample size should be provided with the figure either as an annotation or within the caption. From the above graphic, we see that nearly 28% of volunteers assigned to wildlife experienced adverse respiratory symptoms; the graphic helps address our question, even if not definitively.</p>

<div class="rmdtip">
When you are summarizing only categorical variables, a bar chart is sufficient. Statisticians tend to agree that bar charts are preferable to pie charts (see <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=32&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk6Lf42sfVAhVl64MKHaTdAFY4HhAWCC4wAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.perceptualedge.com%2Farticles%2Fvisual_business_intelligence%2Fsave_the_pies_for_dessert.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFkS-sogmLsZIOheWAPBZSNcqjzkg">this whitepaper</a> and <a href="http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2014/06/alternatives-to-pies">this blog</a> for further explanation).
</div>
<p>While a single type of graphic (bar charts) are helpful for looking at categorical data, summarizing the distribution of a numeric variable requires a bit more thought. Consider the following example.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:summaries-paper" class="example"><strong>Example 6.1  (Paper Strength) </strong></span>While electronic records have become the predominant means of storing information, we do not yet live in a paperless society. Paper products are still used in a variety of applications ranging from printing reports and photography to packaging and bathroom tissue. In manufacturing paper for a particular application, the strength of the resulting paper product is a key characteristic.</p>
<p>There are several metrics for the strength of paper. A conventional metric for assessing the inherent (not dependent upon the physical characteristics, such as the weight of the paper, which might have an effect) strength of paper is the <em>breaking length</em>. This is the length of a paper strip, if suspended vertically from one end, that would break under its own weight. Typically reported in kilometers, the breaking length is computed from other common measurements. For more information on paper strength measurements and standards, see the following website: <a href="http://www.paperonweb.com" class="uri">http://www.paperonweb.com</a></p>
<p>A study was conducted at the University of Toronto to investigate the relationship between pulp fiber properties and the resulting paper properties <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lee1992" role="doc-biblioref">Lee 1992</a>)</span>. The breaking length was obtained for each of the 62 paper specimens, the first 5 measurements of which are shown in Table <a href="Summaries.html#tab:summaries-paper-table">6.1</a>. The complete dataset is available online at the following website: <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/robustbase/pulpfiber.html" class="uri">https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/robustbase/pulpfiber.html</a></p>
<p>While there are several questions one might ask with the available data, here we are primarily interested in characterizing the breaking length of these paper specimens.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="Summaries.html#fig:summaries-paper-dotplot">6.2</a> presents the breaking length for all 62 paper specimens in the sample through a <em>dot plot</em> in which the breaking length for each observed specimen is represented on a number line using a single dot.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 6.2: Breaking Length (km) for 62 paper specimens.
</p>
</div>
<p>With any graphic, we tend to be drawn to three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>where</em> the values tend to be,</li>
<li><em>how tightly</em> the values tend to be clustered there, and</li>
<li><em>the way</em> the values tend to cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that about half of the paper specimens in the sample had a breaking length longer than 21.26 km. Only about 25% of paper specimens had a breaking length less than 19.33 km. These are measures of <em>location</em>. In particular, these are known as <strong>percentiles</strong>, of which the <strong>median</strong>, <strong>first quartile</strong> and <strong>third quartile</strong> are commonly used examples.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-percentile" class="definition"><strong>Definition 6.1  (Percentile) </strong></span>The <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th percentile is the value <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>% of the values in the distribution are less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>25% of values in a distribution are less than or equal to the 25-th percentile (known as the “first quartile” and denoted <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span>).</li>
<li>50% of values in a distribution are less than or equal to the 50-th percentile (known as the “median”).</li>
<li>75% of values in a distribution are less than or equal to the 75-th percentile (known as the “third quartile” and denoted <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The <strong>average</strong> is also a common measure of location. The breaking length of a paper specimen is 21.72 km, on average. In this case, the average breaking length and median breaking length are very close; this need not be the case. The average is not describing the “center” of the data in the same way as the median; they capture different properties.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-average" class="definition"><strong>Definition 6.2  (Average) </strong></span>Also known as the “mean,” this measure of location represents the balance point for the distribution. It is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, it is computed by
<span class="math display">\[\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> rerpesents the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th value in the sample.</p>
<p>When referencing the average for a population, the mean is also called the “Expected Value,” and is often denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Clearly, the breaking length is not equivalent for all paper specimens; that is, there is variability in the measurements. Measures of <em>spread</em> quantify the variability of values within a distribution. Common examples include the <strong>standard deviation</strong> (related to <strong>variance</strong>) and <strong>interquartile range</strong>. For the Paper Strength example, the breaking length varies with a standard deviation of 2.88 km; the interquartile range for the breaking length is 5.2 km.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is often reported more often than the variance since it is on the same scale as the original data; however, as we will see later, the variance is useful from a mathematical perspective for derivations. Neither of these values has a natural interpretation; instead, larger values of these measures simply indicate a higher degree of variability in the data.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-variance" class="definition"><strong>Definition 6.3  (Variance) </strong></span>A measure of spread, this roughly captures the average distance values in the distribution are from the mean.</p>
<p>For a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, it is computed by
<span class="math display">\[s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)^2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the sample mean and <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th value in the sample. The division by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> reduces the bias in the statistic.</p>
<p>The symbol <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is often used to denote the variance in the population.</p>

<p>The measures we have discussed so far are illustrated in Figure <a href="Summaries.html#fig:summaries-summaries">6.3</a>. While some authors suggest the summaries you choose to report depends on the shape of the distribution, we argue that it is best to report the values that align with the question of interest. It is the question that should be shaped by the beliefs about the underlying distribution.</p>

<p>Finally, consider the <em>shape</em> of the distribution of breaking length we have observed. The breaking length tends to be clustered in two locations; we call this <em>bimodal</em> (each mode is a “hump” in the distribution). Other terms used to describe the shape of a distribution are <em>symmetric</em> and <em>skewed</em>. Symmetry refers to cutting a distribution in half (at the median) and the lower half being a mirror image of the upper half; skewed distributions are those which are not symmetric.</p>
<p>Observe then that the dot plot above gives us some idea of the location, spread, and shape of the distribution, in a way that the table of values could not. This makes it a useful graphic as it is characterizing the <strong>distribution of the sample</strong> we have observed. This is one of the four components of what we call the <em>Distributional Quartet</em>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-distribution-sample" class="definition"><strong>Definition 6.6  (Distribution of the Sample) </strong></span>The pattern of variability in the observed values of a variable.</p>
</div>
<p>When the sample is not large, a dot plot is reasonable. Other common visualizations for a single variable include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>jitter plot</em>: similar to a dot plot, each value observed is represented by a dot; the dots are “jittered” (shifted randomly) in order to avoid overplotting when many subjects share the same value of the response.</li>
<li><em>box plot</em>: a visual depiction of five key percentiles; the plot includes the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum value observed. The quartiles are connected with a box, the median cuts the box into two components.</li>
<li><em>histogram</em>: can be thought of as a grouped dot plot in which subjects are “binned” into groups of similar values. The height of each bin represents the number of subjects falling into that bin.</li>
<li><em>density plot</em>: a smoothed histogram in which the y-axis has been standardized so that the area under the curve has value 1. The y-axis is not interpretable directly, but higher values simply mean more likely to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate these graphics, the breaking length for the Paper Strength example is summarized using various methods in Figure <a href="Summaries.html#fig:summaries-univariate">6.4</a>. The latter three visualizations are more helpful when the dataset is very large and plotting the raw values actually hides the distribution. There is no right or wrong graphic; it is about choosing the graphic which addresses the question and adequately portrays the distribution.</p>

<p>The numeric summaries of a distribution are known as <strong>statistics</strong>. While parameters characterize a variable at the population level, statistics characterize a variable at the sample level.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-statistic" class="definition"><strong>Definition 6.7  (Statistic) </strong></span>Numeric quantity which summarizes the distribution of a variable within a <em>sample</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>Why would we compute numerical summaries in the sample if we are interested in the population? Remember the goal of this discipline is to use the sample to say something about the underlying population. As long as the sample is representative, the distribution of the sample should reflect the <strong>distribution of the population</strong>; therefore, summaries of the sample should be close to the analogous summaries of the population (statistics estimate their corresponding parameters). Now we see the real importance of having a representative sample; it allows us to say that what we observe in the sample is a good proxy for what is happening in the population.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-distribution-population" class="definition"><strong>Definition 6.8  (Distribution of the Population) </strong></span>The pattern of variability in values of a variable at the population level. Generally, this is impossible to know, but we might model it.</p>
</div>
<p>That is, the mean in the sample should approximate (estimate) the mean in the population; the standard deviation of the sample should estimate the standard deviation in the population; and, the shape of the sample should approximate the shape of the population, etc. The sample is acting as a representation in all possible ways of the population.</p>

<div class="rmdkeyidea">
A representative sample reflects the population; therefore, we can use statistics as estimates of the population parameters.
</div>

<div class="rmdtip">
<p>We would never use <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> to represent a parameter like the mean of the population. The symbol <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>, etc.) represents observed values being averaged together. Since the values are observed, we must be talking about the sample, and therefore <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> represents a statistic. A similar statement could be made for <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span> (sample variance) compared to <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> (often used to represent population variance, though it can represent other things).</p>
In reality, the symbols themselves are not important. The importance is on their representation. Statistics are observed while parameters are not.

<div id="summarizing-relationships" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Summarizing Relationships</h2>
<p>The summaries discussed above are nice for examining a single variable. In general, research questions of interest typically involve the relationship between two or more variables. Most graphics are two-dimensional (though 3-dimensional graphics and even virtual reality are being utilized now); therefore, summarizing a rich set of relationships may require the use of both axes as well as color, shape, size, and even multiple plots in order to tell the right story. We will explore these various features in upcoming units of the text. Here, we focus on the need to tell a story that answers the question of interest instead of getting lost in making a graphic. Consider the following question from the <a href="CaseDeepwater.html#CaseDeepwater">Deepwater Horizon Case Study</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the increased risk of developing adverse respiratory symptoms for volunteers cleaning wildlife compared to those volunteers who do not have direct exposure to oil?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider the graphic in Figure <a href="Summaries.html#fig:summaries-bad-barchart">6.5</a>; this is <em>not</em> a useful graphic. While it compares the number of volunteers with symptoms in each group, we cannot adequately address the question because the research question involves comparing the rates for the two groups.</p>

<img src="images/summaries-bad-barchart-1.png" alt="Illustration of a poor graphic; the graphic does not give us a sense of the rate within each group in order to make a comparison." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 6.5: Illustration of a poor graphic; the graphic does not give us a sense of the rate within each group in order to make a comparison.
</p>
</div>
<p>Instead, Figure <a href="Summaries.html#fig:summaries-good-barchart">6.6</a> compares the rates within each group. Notice that since we are reporting relative frequencies, we also report the sample size for each group.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:summaries-good-barchart"></span>
<img src="images/summaries-good-barchart-1.png" alt="Comparison of the rate of adverse respiratory symptoms among volunteers assigned to different tasks." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 6.6: Comparison of the rate of adverse respiratory symptoms among volunteers assigned to different tasks.
</p>
</div>
<p>From the graphic, it becomes clear that within the sample a higher fraction of volunteers cleaning wildlife experienced adverse symptoms compared with those without oil exposure. In fact, volunteers cleaning wildlife were 1.79 times more likely to experience adverse respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>The key to a good summary is understanding the question of interest and addressing this question through a useful characterization of the variability.</p>
