<h1><span class="header-section-number">19</span> Elements of Good Study Design</h1>
<p>Thinking about how the data was collected helps us determine how the results generalize beyond the sample itself (to what population the results apply). When our question of interest is about the relationship between two variables (as most questions are), we must also carefully consider the study design. Too often separated from the statistical analysis that follows, keeping the study design in mind should guide the analysis as well as inform us about the conclusions we can draw.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate how study design can impact the results, consider the following example.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:data-kangaroo" class="example"><strong>Example 19.1  (Kangaroo Care) </strong></span>At birth, infants have low levels of Vitamin K, a vitamin needed in order to form blood clots. Though rare, without the ability for her blood to clot, an infant could develop a serious bleed. In order to prevent this, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants be given a Vitamin K shot shortly after birth in order to raise Vitamin K levels. As with any shot, there is typically discomfort to the infant, which can be very discomforting to new parents.</p>
<p>Kangaroo Care is a method of holding a baby which emphasizes skin-to-skin contact. The child, who is dressed only in a diaper, is placed upright on the parent’s bare chest; a light blanket is draped over the child. Suppose we are interested in determining if utilizing the method while giving the child a Vitamin K shot reduces the discomfort in the infant, as measured by the total amount of time the child cries following the shot. Contrast the following two potential study designs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>We allow the attending nurse to determine whether Kangaroo Care is initiated prior to giving the Vitamin K shot. Following the shot, we record the total time (in seconds) the child cries.</li>
<li>We flip a coin. If it comes up heads, the nurse should have the parents implement Kangaroo Care prior to giving the Vitamin K shot; if it comes up tails, the nurse should give the Vitamin K shot without implementing Kagaroo Care. Following the shot, we record the total time (in seconds) the child cries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, in both study designs (A) and (B), we only consider term births which have no complications to avoid situations that might alter the timing of the Vitamin K shot or the ability to implement Kangaroo Care.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that there are some similarities in the two study designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The underlying population is the same for both designs — infants born at term with no complications.</li>
<li>There are two groups being compared in both designs — the “Kangaroo Care” group and the “no Kangaroo Care” group.</li>
<li>The response (variable of interest) is the same in both designs — the time (in seconds) the infant cries.</li>
<li>There is action taken by the researcher in both designs — a Vitamin K shot is given to the child.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one prominent difference between the two study designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>For design (A), the choice of Kangaroo Care is left up to the nurse (self-selected); for design (B), the choice of Kangaroo is <em>assigned</em> to the nurse by the researcher, and this selection is made <em>at random</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Design (A) is an example of an <strong>observational study</strong>; design (B) is a <strong>controlled experiment</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition" label="defn-observational-study">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-2" class="definition"><strong>Definition 19.1  (Observational Study) </strong></span>A study in which each subject “self-selects” into one of groups being compared in the study. The phrase “self-selects” is used very loosely here and can include studies in which the groups are defined by an inherent characteristic or the groups are chosen haphazardly.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-controlled-experiment" class="definition"><strong>Definition 19.2  (Controlled Experiment) </strong></span>A study in which each subject is <em>randomly</em> assigned to one of the groups being compared in the study.</p>
</div>
<p>It is common to think that anytime the environment is “controlled” by the researcher that a controlled experiment is taking place, but the defining characteristic is the random assignment to groups (sometimes referred to as the <em>factor</em> under study or <em>treatment</em> groups). In the example above, both study designs involved a controlled setting (the delivery room of a hospital) in which trained staff (the nurse) deliver the shot. However, only design (B) is a controlled experiment because the researchers randomly determined into which group the infant would be placed.</p>
<p>To understand the impact of random allocation, suppose that we had conducted a study using design (A); further, the results suggest that those infants who were given a shot while using Kangaroo Care cried for a shorter time period, on average. Can we conclude that it was the Kangaroo Care that led to the shorter crying time? Maybe. Consider the following two potential explanations for the resulting data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Kangaroo Care is very effective; as a result, those children who were given Kangaroo Care had reduced crying time, on average, following the Vitamin K shot.</li>
<li>It turns out that those nurses who chose to implement Kangaroo Care (remember, they have a choice under design (A) whether they implement the method) were also the nurses with a gentler bedside manner. Therefore, these nurses tended to be very gentle when giving the Vitamin K shot whereas the nurses who chose not to implement Kangaroo Care tended to just jab the needle in when giving the shot. As a result, the reduced crying time is not a result of the Kangaroo Care but the manner in which the shot was given.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is that we are unable to determine which of the explanations is correct. Given the data we have collected, we are unable to tease out the effect of the Kangaroo Care from that of the nurse’s bedside manner. As a result, we are able to say we observed an <em>association</em> between the use of Kangaroo Care and reduced crying time, but we are unable to conclude that Kangaroo Care <em>caused</em> a reduction in the crying time (that is, there may not be a <em>relationship</em> between the two variables). In this hypothetical scenario, the nurse’s bedside manner is called a <strong>confounder</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-confounding" class="definition"><strong>Definition 19.3  (Confounding) </strong></span>When the effect of a variable on the response is mis-represented due to the presence of a third, potentially unobserved, variable known as a confounder.</p>
</div>
<p>Confounders can mask the relationship between the factor under study and the response. There is a documented association between ice cream sales and the risk of shark attacks. As ice cream sales increase, the risk of a shark attack also tends to increase. This does not mean that if a small city in the Midwest increases its ice cream sales that the citizens are at higher risk of being attacked by a shark. As Figure <a href="study-design.html#fig:data-confounding">19.1</a> illustrates, there is a confounder — temperature. As the temperatures increase, people tend to buy more ice cream; as the temperature increases, people tend to go to the beach increasing the risk of a shark attack. Two variables can appear to be related as a result of a confounder.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<div class="rmdtip">
<p>Confounders are variables that influence <em>both</em> the factor of interest and the response.</p>
</div>
<p>Observational studies are subject to confounding; thus, controlled experiments are often considered the gold standard in research because they allow us to infer cause-and-effect relationships from the data. Why does the random allocation make such an impact? Because it removes the impact of confounders. Let’s return to the hypothetical Vitamin-K study. Suppose there are nurses with a gentle bedside manner and those who are a little less gentle. If the infants are randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, then for every gentle nurse who is told to implement Kangaroo Care while giving the shot, there tends to be a gentle nurse who is told to not implement Kangaroo Care. Similarly, for every mean nurse who is told to implement Kangaroo Care while giving a shot, there tends to be a mean nurse who is told to not implement Kangaroo Care. This is illustrated in Figure <a href="study-design.html#fig:data-randomization">19.2</a>. For an observational study, the treatment groups can be unbalanced; for example, the figure illustrates a case in which there is a higher fraction (11/12 compared to 1/4) of friendly nurses in the Kangaroo Care group compared to the No Kangaroo Care group. For the controlled experiment however, the treatment groups tend to be balanced; there is approximately the same fraction of friendly nurses in both groups. Random assignment is the great equalizer. It tends to result in groups which are similar in all respects; therefore, any differences we observe between the groups <em>must</em> be due to the grouping and not an underlying confounding variable.</p>

Figure 19.2: Illustration of the impact of random assignment in study design. For the observational study, the treatment groups are unbalanced. For the controlled experiment, the treatment groups are balanced.

<div class="rmdkeyidea">
<p>Randomly assigning subjects to groups balances the groups with respect to any confounders; that is, the groups being compared are similar. Therefore, any differences between the two groups can be attributed to the grouping factor itself, leading to cause-and-effect conclusions.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that in the example above, multiple nurses were enrolled in each group of interest. While this may seem obvious, it is an important element of study design.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-replication" class="definition"><strong>Definition 19.4  (Replication) </strong></span>Taking measurements on <em>independent</em> units of observation, for which you expect the results to be similar (not the same).</p>
<ul>
<li>That is, any variability is due to natural variability within the population.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows us to quantify the variability between units within the population.</p>
</div>
<div class="rmdwarning">
<p>Be cautious of pseudo-replicates; these are repeated observations on the same unit. In this case, these observations are not independent and are not true replicates.</p>
</div>
<p>As discussed above, random assignment differentiates observational studies and controlled experiments. Randomization, in general, is an effective tool for study design.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-randomization" class="definition"><strong>Definition 19.5  (Randomization) </strong></span>Refers to the random selection of units which minimizes bias and random allocation of units which permits causal interpretation.</p>
</div>
<p>Randomization allows us to make statements which are generalizable and/or causal. In the ideal, randomization would play a role in every study. However, due to some limitations, we must accept that randomization is not always possible or practical.</p>
<p>Intuitively, we would like the groups being compared (also known as the levels of the factor under study) to be as similar as possible; this is the idea of comparative groups.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:defn-comparative-groups" class="definition"><strong>Definition 19.6  (Comparative Groups) </strong></span>When treatment groups (levels of the factor under study) are as similar as possible to reduce external variability in the process.</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to note that such additional variability will not bias the results or make our results confounded. The randomization (if we use it) will take care of these aspects. It is that by reducing the additional variability, we are able to gain power. That is, we are able to more easily find a difference if one really exists.</p>
